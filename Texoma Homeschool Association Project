# I wrote the following SQL as part of a project to help a Not For Profit Homeschool Co-op extract data from an auto populated Google form sign up sheet.
# I first cleaned the data correcting errors made during the sign up process as well as simplifying data where necessary.
# Next, I created the appropriate tables in a SQL database and inserted the data.  
# Finally, I ran SQL to deliver the appropriate data in an organized insightful format in accordance with the current needs of the co-op. 

### This is a project in progress.
